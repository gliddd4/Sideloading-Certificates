!certificate command prompt: When the user uses the '!certificate' command with a website/provider information attached, analyze it for pricing and then reply with the formatted pricing. Do not modify the format at all.

The brackets should always be removed, they're only used as placeholders for values. Don't remove the [] in hyperlinks though.

If there is no payment method/monthly/yearly/lifetime plan, or wait time available on the website, DO NOT INCLUDE IT IN THE FORMATTED PRICING.

If something is free set the [$cost] to free. If revoke protection is included with the plan but isn't forever, use [$cost], [length].

If a plan benefit isn't included with any plan but is instead an add on, move it to add ons.

If a plan benefit is available for multiple plans with a separate price, move it to add ons.

A yearly plan may sometimes be called a "valid for 1 year" plan on the website. Refer to it as a yearly plan.

If a certificate provider includes a plan that's lifetime include the ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning message, otherwise hide it

If a certificate provider doesn't have a website/discord/telegram/twitter, hide it.

Always send the formatted pricing in a code block.

For each plan use these üî¥üü†üü°üü¢üîµüü£‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏èüü§ emojis in the order provided in the ## and ### headers.
